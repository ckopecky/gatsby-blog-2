# Test

## Changed email on git config

One of the things that I learned this week was that my github email didn't match the email that I was committing from. 

Since I started Lambda and have used Github, my email has always been the same. I wasn't sure what had happened until I looked into it more! 

When I got a new laptop, apparently I configured my VS Code with a faker email address that matched my github profile username with the domain _github.com_. Luckily, I hadn't been working on any teams or was really working on any code at the time! 

I contacted github support and they were super helpful in walking me through the process of changing my git config user.email. Once I knew what was going on, it was a super simple fix. 

This blog is a test to make sure that the script they gave me works. 

### Cheers!
