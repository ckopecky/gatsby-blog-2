My main tasks this week were to be sure that the UI/UX was consistent for the navbar, footer, hero and search results. In addition, I spent an entire Lambda day creating the documentation for the README file.

__Accomplishments?__

I implemented a CSS Reset and set Default values so that font-sizes and button color would remain consistent throughout the application.  We decided on a muted color scheme to let the content speak for itself. I created a codepen to indicate what the default font-sizes, default button and icon colors that were to be used:

The biggest technical accomplishment for me this week was getting the footer to work properly in desktop and mobile views. With no bootstrap implementation here, I used my own custom CSS to create something that hopefully comes across as less busy than the previous implementation.

I used classes to customize a look for both desktop and mobile views without having to create a whole new component for the mobile view.

In addition, I spent 8 Lambda Hours on creating the Documentation for the Project. There are still some edits I would like to make, but that was a major accomplishment for me this week:

I also wrote, at the request of the instructors, a description of our application and added it to our 'About' page:
